#  Car Sales Analysis & Prediction

### Project Overview
This project analyses car sales data from 2022 to 2023 to uncover market trends, customer behaviours, and pricing drivers. The goal was to move beyond basic descriptive statistics into predictive modelling and advanced customer segmentation.

### What I Did
* **Data Cleaning:** Processed raw data by handling missing values, fixing data types, and removing aggregation artefacts to ensure accuracy.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualised the relationship between annual income and luxury car purchases, revealing that brand preference is not strictly tied to income brackets.
* **Machine Learning:** Built a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict vehicle prices based on features like gender, region, and body style.
* **Advanced Clustering:** Implemented **K-Means Clustering** (Unsupervised Learning) to mathematically identify distinct customer personas ("Value Seekers" vs. "High-End Buyers") based on spending power.

### Tech Stack
* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, K-Means)

### Key Takeaway
The analysis highlights that while income correlates with price, regional and demographic factors (like specific trends in Austin, TX) are stronger indicators of profitability than income alone.
